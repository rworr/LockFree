Data structures designed to be lock-free using CAS (Compare-And-Swap) instead of other synchronization primitives, such as mutexes. Developed in C++ using Visual Studio 2012, with performance analysis done using Intel's VTune Amplifier. Source code is in /LockFree, performance results are in /Performance.
